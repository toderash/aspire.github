# AspirePress Community Code of Conduct

The AspirePress community welcomes contributors from around the world to help us make AspirePress. We aim to express our shared expectations of how we, as contributors, work together, who we want to build our products for, and the AspirePress interpretation of modern, open source best practices.

## Our Pledge

We as members, contributors, and leaders pledge to make participation in our community a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of age, body size, visible or invisible disability, ethnicity, sex characteristics, gender identity and expression, level of experience, education, socio-economic status, nationality, personal appearance, race, caste, color, religion, or sexual identity and orientation.

We pledge to act and interact in ways that contribute to an open, welcoming, diverse, and inclusive community.

## Our Expectations

Examples of behavior that contributes to a positive environment for our community include:

* Demonstrating empathy and kindness toward other people
* Being respectful of differing opinions, viewpoints, and experiences
* Giving and gracefully accepting constructive feedback
* Accepting responsibility and apologizing to those affected by our mistakes, and learning from the experience
* Focusing on what is best not just for us as individuals, but for the overall community

Examples of unacceptable behavior include:

* The use of sexualized language or imagery, and sexual attention or advances of any kind
* Insulting or derogatory comments, taunting or baiting, and personal or political attacks
* Public or private harassment
* Publishing others’ private information, such as a physical or email address, without their explicit permission
* Other conduct which could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a professional setting

## Complaints and Enforcement

If you feel that a member of the community has violated this Code of Conduct in their actions or behaviors, you may reach out to the community leaders at support@aspirepress.org. If you feel that the community leaders have vioalted this Code of Conduct, please connect with 2 or 3 additional community members, share your concerns, and as a group, please reach out to support@aspirepress.org. If you do not receive satisfaction within three days, you may request a hearing of the full community. The community of contributors will be obligated to take a vote on the complaint and determine, if appropriate, a resolution.
