# Aspire Cloud Hosting Policy

## Preamble

The goal of Aspire Cloud Repository is to provide a robust distributed source for downloading software for extending WordPress and related compatible CMSs. The Distributed Software Repository project is released freely in order to establish a network of trusted repositories which democratize software distribution free from the control of any one person or organization.

This DRAFT policy governs what software will be accepted to host on AspirePress Cloud. At the project's inception, we are providing a general list of requirements and deferring to the corresponding [guidelines available at wordpress.org](https://developer.wordpress.org/plugins/wordpress-org/detailed-plugin-guidelines/) for interpretation until they have been fully rewritten in this document. While this document is in draft form, in case of conflicts or updates, the guideline explanations below will supersede any others.

If you believe you have a case where a software package would not be accepted for hosting on wordpress.org, but believe it should be allowed on Aspire Cloud, please contact support@aspirepress.org.
