# AspirePress Community Code of Conduct

## Preamble

This preamble does not form a part of the Community Code of Conduct, but outlines our approach to the matter. At the very beginning, we would state it this way: if there's a question as to whether an action or statement of any form is within the Code of Conduct, chances are it's crossed the line. Any Code of Conduct should be viewed not as a boundary to stay within, but to zone to see how far away from it you can stay. If you're checking a Code of Conduct to see what you're allowed to say or do, you've missed the point entirely.

The AspirePress Community welcomes contributors and supporters from around the world. We are more of a [centered set than a bounded set](https://scottsmeester.medium.com/you-must-choose-a-new-mindset-cce94ce15f58), as sociologist and cultural anthropologist Paul Hiebert conceived of the distinction. Codes of Conduct work in much the same way: rather than focusing on the boundary to determine whether you're in or you're out, focus on the center and move in that direction. In other words, simply forcus on showing and communicating respect for every person. With this mindset, any actual boundary ceases to matter because nobody approaches it except from the outside on their way in.  Our Code of Conduct describes and embraces that path. For the health of our community and the safety of its members, it also defines the boundary.

## Our Pledge

We as members, contributors, and leaders pledge to make participation in our community a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of age, body size, visible or invisible disability, ethnicity, sex characteristics, gender identity and expression, level of experience, education, socio-economic status, nationality, personal appearance, race, caste, color, religion, or sexual identity and orientation.

We pledge to act and interact in ways that contribute to an open, welcoming, diverse, inclusive, and healthy community.

## Our Standards

Examples of behavior that contributes to a positive environment for our community include:

* Demonstrating empathy and kindness toward other people
* Being respectful of differing opinions, viewpoints, and experiences
* Giving and gracefully accepting constructive feedback
* Accepting responsibility and apologizing to those affected by our mistakes, and learning from the experience
* Focusing on what is best not just for us as individuals, but for the overall community

Examples of unacceptable behavior include:

* The use of sexualized language or imagery, and sexual attention or advances of any kind
* Trolling, insulting or derogatory comments, and personal or political attacks
* Public or private harassment
* Publishing others' private information, such as a physical or email address, without their explicit permission
* Other conduct which could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a professional setting

## Enforcement Responsibilities

Community leaders are responsible for clarifying and enforcing our standards of acceptable behavior and will take appropriate and fair corrective action in response to any behavior that they deem inappropriate, threatening, offensive, or harmful.

Community leaders have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or reject comments, commits, code, wiki edits, issues, and other contributions that are not aligned to this Code of Conduct, and will communicate reasons for moderation decisions when appropriate.

## Scope

This Code of Conduct applies within all community spaces, and also applies when an individual is officially representing the community in public spaces. Examples of representing our community include using an official email address, posting via an official social media account, or acting as an appointed representative at an online or offline event.

## Enforcement

All community leaders are obligated to respect the privacy and security of the reporter of any incident.
