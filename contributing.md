# Contributing

Contributions are **welcome** and will be fully **credited**.

We accept contributions via Pull Requests on [Github](https://github.com/AspirePress) to the appropriate package.

## Pull Requests

### WordPress Plugins & Projects

For WordPress Plugins and Projects, we ask that you follow these standards:

- Use the [WordPress Coding Standard](https://developer.wordpress.org/coding-standards/wordpress-coding-standards/). You can automate this with [PHPCS](https://github.com/WordPress/WordPress-Coding-Standards), and we recommend you do.
- We ask (but do not require) that you write tests for your contributions. We understand that unit testing the WordPress framework is difficult.
- Please document any changes in behavior inside the pull request so we can easily update the CHANGELOG when we release a new version.
- If your changes break backwards compatibility with the current stable version, it MUST be released as part of the next major version. Please target your Pull Request against the branch for the next major version or, if one is not created, ask that one be created for you. Additionally, any breaking changes should provide a migration between the old version(s) and a new version.
- All code contributed to WordPress-related plugins and projects, _especially_ code that touches the GPL'ed WordPress code, is subject to the GPL as well, and you agree to license your code under the GPL as a condition of committing and merging your code with ours. See the Copyright section below for more.

### For Non-WordPress Libraries & Components

For non-WordPress repositories (e.g. libraries and components that are tangential but do not call into WordPress core),
we apply the following standards:

- We use the [Laminas Coding Standard](https://docs.laminas.dev/laminas-coding-standard/) with certain rules turned off.
- We require tests to be written for code that you commit, and we encourage you to run the tests prior to opening a pull request.
- We require that the code you submit pass PHPStan Level 6 or higher.
- Please document changes you make to the CHANGELOG inside each project, so we know what changes were made, and use that information in your Pull Request.
- Please be sure to document the WHY of your request, not just the WHAT. For example, "Changed class to be more readable" is not a good commit message. "Changed class to be more readable" followed on another line by "The Foo class was hard to read due to some complex logic. I simplified the logic by implementing a bubble sort algorithm, which reduced the complexity and improved the readability" is a much clearer message.
- Please try to keep the first line of your commit message to 80 characters or less, and use subsequent lines to communicate additional information.
- Pull requests should be 10 or fewer files and +/- 500 lines of code. If yours exceeds this, we will want you to explain why, and we may ask you to break up the request into logical parts.
- If your change breaks backwards compatibility, please target the next major version branch. If one has not been created, request that we create it for you. We cannot accept backwards-compatibility breaking changes in the current version, as this violates Semantic Versioning.
- All code contributed is subject to the license of the repository to which it is contributed. You agree to release your code under that license.

## General Rules For Contributing

We welcome contributions. We encourage anyone who wants to contribute to do so. These rules outline our policies in
accepting contributions.

1. Always fork the repository to your own GitHub profile, and do your work in branches there. Do not push branches directly to the AspirePress repository, even if you have access to do so. Note that branches related to releases is perfectly acceptable
2. To contribute your patch, please open a Pull Request, even if you have access to push to `main`. Since you're likely doing your work in your own fork, this makes a pull request more essential.
3. Please make sure your code passes CI/CD before creating a pull request. You can run `make check` locally on most repositories to ensure that they comply with our style, quality and test coverages.
4. Please honor and follow our style guidelines.
5. Please do not merge your own Pull Request. Allow it to be merged by the reviewer once review is complete, or the review has been approved. **If you push new changes after review is approved, it must be reviewed again!** Project leads _may_ merge their own pull requests, but are highly encouraged to seek review from the community, first.
6. Please take feedback seriously, if it's offered. We won't generally reject a pull request on spec, and we will often offer feedback as to why we don't think it's a good fit or what needs to change. If you honor our feedback, we're more likely to accept your pull request.
7. Issues will be closed by the team lead when they have been tested by a quality assurance lead, if available, or another developer. Please do not close issues before they are tested.
8. Remember that this is a) an open-source project run by volunteers and b) an open-source project that you are welcome to fork or work with under the terms of the license. Please feel free to use the code, fork the project, or do what you like, especially if we can't incorporate your recommendations. But please also honor our [Governance Rules](GOVERNANCE.md).

## Branching and Workflow

We use a centralized approach that leaves `main` as the current development version. We also may have a stable branch, version branches for bug and feature fixes in the specific version. Since we use [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/) we need to provide ways that we can adequately maintain and/or add features to existing versions, without breaking backwards compatibility.

- The `main` branch is the source of truth for the bleeding edge of the project. It should be used for applying all new features and bugfixes that affect new and existing features.
- The version branch (e.g. `1.x`) is used for bugfixes specific to features in that version.
- Bugfixes that apply to `main` that also apply to a version branch should be applied to `main` and then applied to the version branch. Fixes that apply ONLY to the version branch should target that branch specifically.
- New features should be developed against `main` **first**. If the new feature is applicable to a version branch and the changes in `main` do not break backwards compatibility, you can merge that feature into the version branch.
- Backwards compatibility should always be maintained in version branches **unless** doing so creates a security problem.
- Features must be developed in feature branches that you create in your own [fork](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/working-with-forks/fork-a-repo) of the project you're working on. Once the feature is ready, open a pull request against `main` or the version branch if applicable.
- Pull requests should have the commits squashed and merged as a single commit to ease backporting and/or merging upstream.
- We maintain a CHANGELOG in every project that should follow the [Keep A Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/) specification. For unreleased changes, keep an " Unreleased" section in the changelog. Update the changelog to the version you plan to deploy BEFORE tagging and move unreleased changes to that changelog. Make sure that you update ALL OTHER BRANCHES (`main` and version branches) with the changelog information so that the changelog is consistent.
- Once a feature branch is merged into the main project or a version branch, it _should not_ be used again. It should be deleted and a new feature branch started from the latest version of the project.
- Once `main` begins to drift significantly from a version branch, such that it becomes difficult or impossible to merge items from `main` into the version branch, that version is considered discontinued and we should be making plans for a new major version.
- When a new major version is issued, we need to create a version branch with that major version's revision number (e.g. `2.x`) for future development. We do not do minor version branches.
